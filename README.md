# Rockbuster Project
## Objective
The objective of this project is to prepare Rockbuster, a movie rental company, for the launch of its online movie rental service. A comprehensive business analysis is conducted to address key business questions from various departments and to inform strategic planning for the launch.

# Data
The Rockbuster dataset includes detailed information on payments, rentals, and customers. It comprises a total of 15 tables, each with specific data, which are imported into a relational database management system (RDBMS) and documented in a data dictionary.

Steps & Tools
- DbVisualizer: Used to extract the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and create a data dictionary.
- SQL: Used to import, manipulate, and extract data from the database. The data was then exported to an Excel file for further analysis.
- Tableau: Utilized to create data visualizations from the exported Excel data.
