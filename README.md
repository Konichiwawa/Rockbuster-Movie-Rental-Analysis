# Rockbuster Movie Rental Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to assist Rockbuster, a movie rental company, in preparing for the launch of its online movie rental service. The project includes a comprehensive business analysis to address key questions from various departments (e.g., marketing, operations, finance) and to inform strategic planning for a successful online service launch.

## Data Overview
The dataset used for the analysis includes detailed information about payments, rentals, and customers. It consists of 15 tables, each containing specific data on different aspects of the business. These tables have been imported into a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for storage, and the database schema is documented in a data dictionary.

## Tools
- DbVisualizer: Used to extract the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and create a data dictionary for understanding the structure of the database.
- SQL: Employed to import, manipulate, and extract data from the RDBMS. The data was then exported to an Excel file for additional analysis.
- Tableau: Used to create interactive data visualizations that highlight key insights and inform business decisions based on the analysis.
